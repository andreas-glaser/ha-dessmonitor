## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Future development in progress

## [1.4.9] - 2025-09-30

### Added
- Persistent token caching and refresh mechanism to reduce authentication overhead and improve reliability

### Changed
- Modularized API data flow and diagnostics for improved maintainability

### Fixed
- Deduplicated diagnostic priority sensors to prevent duplicate entity creation

## [1.4.8] - 2025-09-26

### Fixed
- Resolve 500 Internal Server Error during integration configuration that prevented users from setting up the integration
- Remove problematic nested `vol.Schema(lambda)` validators in configuration flow that caused Voluptuous serialization errors

## [1.4.7] - 2025-09-25

### Changed
- Documented the requirement to wait for passing CI runs before tagging releases in the commit and release guides.

### Fixed
- Adjusted integration formatting to satisfy linting so the CI pipeline succeeds.

## [1.4.6] - 2025-09-25

### Fixed
- Treat DessMonitor authentication timeouts as retryable `ConfigEntryNotReady` errors so Home Assistant keeps retrying setup instead of failing permanently.
- Handle cancelled aiohttp requests as timeouts in the DessMonitor API client to avoid silent setup crashes.

## [1.4.5] - 2025-09-25

### Changed
- Improved DessMonitor API error logging with detailed HTTP status and response diagnostics for easier troubleshooting of 500 errors.
- Added Git/GitHub workflow guide covering branching, tagging, and release process.

## [1.4.4] - 2025-09-14

### Added
- CLI: New `sp-keys` command to query SP Key Parameters for a device, with graceful fallbacks and `--raw` output option.
- CLI Docs: Usage section for `sp-keys` with examples and notes.

### Changed
- README: Added "Supported Inverter Brands" section (PowMr, EASUN Power, MPP Solar, MUST Power, Voltronic Axpert rebrands, Fronus Solar) and improved Quick Start HACS link formatting.
- Release Guide: Added practical git log commands and branch sync guidance for preparing changelogs.

### Removed
- Deprecated `custom_components/dessmonitor/device_mappings.py` in favor of `device_support/` devcode-based architecture.
